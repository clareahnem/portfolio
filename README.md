# purpose  
This portfolio pagae was created to showcase my coding skills with a particular focus on HTML and CSS/SCSS. 
The website was created with a purpose to showcase my current web development skill to the employers and other stakeholders of the tech industry, as well as the teachers and student cohort at Coder Academy. In order to challenge my knowledge and capabilities on HTML and CSS/SCSS, this page was created without the use of scripting languages such as JavaScript or Ruby.

# theme  
The main theme of this portfolio website is "simple, clean and fresh". While individualiity and uniqueness is a great strength in showcasing your personality, I aimed to make the content and the features of the webpage more prominent than its visual appearance for this project. Hence, I aimed to use minimal range of colors and font styles to keep the design aspect relatively simple. 

For the colors, I decided to use white and light blue prodominantly. According to color theories, white is often associated with innocence and symbolises new beginnings, while light blue is associated with trustworthiness and reliability. As an individual who recently started coding, these two colors felt very fit for this project. To keep with my color theme, I chose to use an image of the sky with white clouds for the main background. Skies and clouds are often symbols of open spaces, imagination, dreams and inspiration - as a beginner who is making a new start in this industry, the theme felt extremely appropriate to use. 

# features  
All of the pages on this website features a navigation bar, main content and a footer, which were formatted using a Grid display. The navigation bar is fixed on top of the screen (i.e. will not scroll out of the viewport) and contains links to different HTML pages with logos for simple yet user-friendly appearance. Text-shadow feature was incorporated to give each link a cloud-like appearance to keep with the theme, as well as keyframes that make the logo "glow" when they are hovered over. 

The footer is positiined so that it will always appear at the bottom of the page, and features links to my LinkedIn, GutHub and Codepen profiles. These links are each given the 'target="_blank"' attribute so that when an audience click on the link, the profile will open on a new tab. 

As for the main section of the page, each of the 5 HTML pages contain the following features; 
1. Home page
    -this page includes a brief introduction about myself and a description on how to navigate the page. The themes and main components of this page is used consistently throughout this portfolio, including the keyframes and font styling for headings and text colors of paragraphs. In order to make this page visually appealing in all media devices, flexbox display was used for components in '<main>' tags to give a responsive design. 
2. About Me page
    -The main purpose of this page is to let the audience know a little bit about myself by describing my personality, study history and interests. It includes an insight on how I became interested in Coding and what led me to study at Coder Academy. The PDF of my resume is also linked on this site to showcase my work and study history outside of coding experiences. I have incorporated keyframes on the skill section of this page, where if you hover on the logos of each skill such as the HTML 5 logo, it will be enlarged, spin 360 degrees and shrink back to its original size - a fun little feature for visual entertainment. 
3. Project page
    -This is a simple page that showcases my past web development projects that I have worked on including those that I have done for Coder Academy classes and those I have worked on outside of this school. It gives the audience an idea of what I have been doing throughout my coding journey. At this current point in time this portfolio itself is the most complex piece of webpage I have created, hence viewers will be able to see how my skills have improved through vewing the projects that are listed on this page. However when there are more projects that I would consider more valuable for showcasing to the target audience, they would most likely replace the ones that are being listed at the moment. As for the visual styling, this page changes its visual appearance dramatically when screen size is larger (i.e. desktop size), where each project section appears small until you hover over. when hovered over, the project of interest will expand its size so viewers are able to see the project image more clearly. In order to make this transition smoother, keyframes were incorporated for when they are hovered over, as well as when they are unhovered. 
4. Blog Posts
    -This page features 5 separate blog posts about my personal travel journeys. However the highlight of this page is not the article content, but is on how I styled the blog posts using css/scss. The 5 posts are all separated by '<div>' tags and displayed in flexboxes, and is the page where keyframes and media queries are used most comprehensively to showcase my understanding of CSS features and responsive design.
    -in any screen sizes, each blog post content is hidden in '<detail>' tag where viewers must expand the tag in order to read the content. This allows for the page to be simplified and hence easier to navigate through. However the downside of the '<detail>' tag is that the contents will only fold unless you click on the '<summary>' located at rhe top of the '<detail>' content. Since the blog article contents are relatively long, when articles are viewed on a mobile screen the viewers must navigate themselves back to the top of the article in order to fold the content back. In order to simplify this process, I have added a button at the end of each article content that links back to its post heading, so that viewers can easily fold the blog article content back for a simplified view of the page. I have styled this button to be only visible on mobile-sized screens, as larger screens are already easy enough to navigate back to the post heading without its use.
5. Contact Page
    -This page includes a simple form for page viewers to contact myself directly. The purpose of this is to acquire feedback, job and experience offers and general comments from the readers. Those who wishes to write back must submit their email and must also input text in the textfield, as they have been given the 'required' attribute in their respective '<input>' tags. Each response will be sent to my coder academy email, so that I can respond back if necessary. Any feedback will be read and referenced for my self improvement in the future.
