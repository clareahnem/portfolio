        <h2 class="subtitle">My Study History</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently learning to code at Coder Academy as a beginner. I have
          always been more of a logic-based thinker than a creative type - I
          preferred mathematics and science at school over essay writings and
          art. Even during University I studied a Bachelor of Science majoring
          in Psychology - but I never thought to explore tech side of the world
          until I was stuck at home like everybody else due to the pandemic. I
          was eager to challenge myself for self-growth during this time, hence
          I took the opportunity to take free introductory courses on multiple
          fields. One of the courses I came across was a web development class
          and I was instantly drawn to it. From then I have been self learning
          using free online programs like freeCodeCamp, Dash and codecademy.
          While it is quite challenging and frustrating at times, I an throughly
          enjoying the learning process, especially now that I am attending
          Coder Academy.

        <h2 class="subtitle">My Personality & Interests</h2>
        <p>
          In the past couple of years I discovered my love for travel. After I
          graduated form The University of Melbourne, I left Australia for a
          year long travel to Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Canada, and
          I truly loved every moment of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love the little things in life, like drinking coffee in the
          morning, listening to some music on the train, putting makeup on,
          sitting on the grass and feeling the breeze...etc. I believe they give
          you time to breathe and let your mind wander off, so I have been
          appreciate these little moments.
